# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​
Objective: This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage, a pivotal factor in estimating launch costs for SpaceX, ultimately assisting the emerging company, Space Y, in strategizing competitive pricing for their rocket launches.​

Data-Driven Decision Making: This project involves leveraging data science and machine learning to predict first stage reusability, a crucial determinant in cost estimation. By collecting and analyzing relevant data, including mission parameters and historical success rates, the aim is to provide Space Y with predictive insights into reusability.​

Significance of First Stage Reusability: SpaceX's cost-efficiency is driven by reusability, particularly in the Falcon 9 first stage. This initiative drastically reduces launch costs, positioning SpaceX competitively by offering Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, a stark contrast to competitors' prices exceeding $165 million per launch.​

Strategic Edge for Space Y: Armed with accurate predictions on first stage reusability, Space Y can strategically set launch prices, optimize business strategies, and compete effectively with industry giants like SpaceX, catalyzing innovation in the commercial space domain.​
